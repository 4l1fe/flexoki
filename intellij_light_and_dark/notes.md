I used a `BASH` [Replit](https://replit.com) instance to generate the themes using [colorSchemeTool](https://github.com/JetBrains/colorSchemeTool) with a bit of help from [VSCode Theme to PyCharm, PhpStorm, WebStorm, Jetbrain Color scheme Conversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7TQRivAWA4). Checked with the author of the previous PR for Jetbrains IDEs version (@loudar) and they suggested another PR.
